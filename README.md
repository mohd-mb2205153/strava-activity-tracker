# strava-activity-tracker
A Google Sheets-based dashboard that automatically pulls and logs physical activity data (running, cycling, swimming, gym, etc.) from a STRAVA Club — DZ Riders — using the STRAVA API. Displays member activity by type, with date, time, athlete name, distance, and duration for easy tracking and analysis.
